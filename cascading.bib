abstract = {Degradation of coastal water quality in the form of low dissolved oxygen levels (hypoxia) can harm biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human wellbeing. Extreme hypoxic conditions along the coast, leading to what are often referred to as "dead zones," are known primarily from temperate regions. However, little is known about the potential threat of hypoxia in the tropics, even though the known risk factors, including eutrophication and elevated temperatures, are common. Here we document an unprecedented hypoxic event on the Caribbean coast of Panama and assess the risk of dead zones to coral reefs worldwide. The event caused coral bleaching and massive mortality of corals and other reef-associated organisms, but observed shifts in community structure combined with laboratory experiments revealed that not all coral species are equally sensitive to hypoxia. Analyses of global databases showed that coral reefs are associated with more than half of the known tropical dead zones worldwide, with >10% of all coral reefs at elevated risk for hypoxia based on local and global risk factors. Hypoxic events in the tropics and associated mortality events have likely been underreported, perhaps by an order of magnitude, because of the lack of local scientific capacity for their detection. Monitoring and management plans for coral reef resilience should incorporate the growing threat of coastal hypoxia and include support for increased detection and research capacity.},

abstract = {Global climate change is driving species poleward and upward in high-latitude regions, but the extent to which the biodiverse tropics are similarly affected is poorly known due to a scarcity of historical records. In 1802, Alexander von Humboldt ascended the Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador. He recorded the distribution of plant species and vegetation zones along its slopes and in surrounding parts of the Andes. We revisited Chimborazo in 2012, precisely 210 y after Humboldt's expedition. We documented upward shifts in the distribution of vegetation zones as well as increases in maximum elevation limits of individual plant taxa of >500 m on average. These range shifts are consistent with increased temperatures and glacier retreat on Chimborazo since Humboldt's study. Our findings provide evidence that global warming is strongly reshaping tropical plant distributions, consistent with Humboldt's proposal that climate is the primary control on the altitudinal distribution of vegetation.},

abstract = {Rapid biological changes are expected to occur on tropical elevational gradients as species migrate upslope or go extinct in the face of global warming. We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters {\&}gt;10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for {\&}lt;3% of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.},

abstract = {To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological and social systems, we introduce an information theoretic approach that reveals community structure in weighted and directed networks. We use the probability flow of random walks on a network as a proxy for information flows in the real system and decompose the network into modules by compressing a description of the probability flow. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of >6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network-including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine-information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

abstract = {P>Predicting regime shifts - drastic changes in dynamic behaviour - is a key challenge in ecology and other fields. Here we show that the class of ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in combination with environmental variability lead to model descriptions that will not have smooth potentials, concluding that many ecological systems are described by systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then illustrate the impact of these general arguments by numerically examining the dynamics of several model ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our results offer a cautionary note about the generality of forecasting sudden changes in ecosystems.},

abstract = {Catastrophic events share characteristic nonlinear behaviors that are often generated by cross-scale interactions and feedbacks among system elements. These events result in surprises that cannot easily be predicted based on information obtained at a single scale. Progress on catastrophic events has focused on one of the following two areas: nonlinear dynamics through time without an explicit consideration of spatial connectivity [Holling, C. S. (1992) EcoL Monogr. 62, 447-502] or spatial connectivity and the spread of contagious processes without a consideration of cross-scale interactions and feedbacks [Zeng, N., Neeling, J. D., Lau, L. M. {\&} Tucker, C. J. (1999) Science 286, 1537-1540]. These approaches rarely have ventured beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. We provide an interdisciplinary, conceptual, and general mathematical framework for understanding and forecasting nonlinear dynamics through time and across space. We illustrate the generality and usefulness of our approach by using new data and recasting published data from ecology (wildfires and desertification), epidemiology (infectious diseases), and engineering (structural failures). We show that decisions that minimize the likelihood of catastrophic events must be based on cross-scale interactions, and such decisions will often be counterintuitive. Given the continuing challenges associated with global change, approaches that cross disciplinary boundaries to include interactions and feedbacks at multiple scales are needed to increase our ability to predict catastrophic events and develop strategies for minimizing their occurrence and impacts. Our framework is an important step in developing predictive tools and designing experiments to examine cross-scale interactions.},

abstract = {The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) introduced a new framework for analyzing social-ecological systems that has had wide influence in the policy and scientific communities. Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social-ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social-ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

The database currently contains 27 generic types of regime shifts, and over 300 specific case studies of a variety of regime shifts. These regime shifts occur across diverse types of systems and are driven by many different types of processes. Besides impacting provisioning and regulating services, our work shows that regime shifts substantially impact cultural and aesthetic ecosystem services. We found that social-ecological feedbacks are difficult to characterize and more work is needed to develop new tools and approaches to better understand social-ecological regime shifts. We hope that the database will stimulate further research on regime shifts and make available information that can be used in management, planning and assessment.},

abstract = {Phase transitions--changes between different states of organization in a complex system--have long helped to explain physics concepts, such as why water freezes into a solid or boils to become a gas. How might phase transitions shed light on important problems in biological and ecological complex systems? Exploring the origins and implications of sudden changes in nature and society, Phase Transitions examines different dynamical behaviors in a broad range of complex systems. Using a compelling set of examples, from gene networks and ant colonies to human language and the degradation of diverse ecosystems, the book illustrates the power of simple models to reveal how phase transitions occur. Introductory chapters provide the critical concepts and the simplest mathematical techniques required to study phase transitions. In a series of example-driven chapters, Ricard Sol{\'e} shows how such concepts and techniques can be applied to the analysis and prediction of complex system behavior, including the origins of life, viral replication, epidemics, language evolution, and the emergence and breakdown of societies. Written at an undergraduate mathematical level, this book provides the essential theoretical tools and foundations required to develop basic models to explain collective phase transitions for a wide variety of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Many ecosystems can experience regime shifts: surprising, large and persistent changes in the function and structure of ecosystems. Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers.},

This book offers a comprehensive introduction to critical transitions in complex systems--the radical changes that happen at tipping points when thresholds are passed. Marten Scheffer accessibly describes the dynamical systems theory behind critical transitions, covering catastrophe theory, bifurcations, chaos, and more. He gives examples of critical transitions in lakes, oceans, terrestrial ecosystems, climate, evolution, and human societies. And he demonstrates how to deal with these transitions, offering practical guidance on how to predict tipping points, how to prevent "bad" transitions, and how to promote critical transitions that work for us and not against us. Scheffer shows the time is ripe for understanding and managing critical transitions in the vast and complex systems in which we live. This book can also serve as a textbook and includes a detailed appendix with equations.

annote = {"Coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems generally represent the most productive large marine ecosytems of the world's ocean, in terms of both primary production rates and tonnage of exploitable fish produced. The Peruvian upwelling system, in particular, stands out as a major factor in worlds fish production. The Pacific rade winds have traditionally hbeen considered to be the primary driving force for the upwelling system off Peru, but are projected to weaken as climate change proceeds. This leads to the concern that the upwelling process in the Peru system, to which its productivity is linked, may likewise weaken. However, other mechanisms involving greenhouse-associated intensification of thermal low-pressure cells over the coastal landmasses of upwelling regions of the world's oceans"

"Here we summarize available evidence for the intensification mechanism and present a proxy test that uses variation sin water vapor, the dominant natural greenhouse gas , to offer multiple-realization empirical evidence for action of the proposed mechanism in the real world situation"

"While different analyses of the 20th century data give conflicting results (), a recent analysis of climate model simulation has concluded that the trade wind in the equatorial Pacific have weakened in response to the progressive build up of atmospheric greenhoses gases ()"

"Opposing this particular concern are earlier premises () that predict intensification of coastal upwelling in major upwelling zones of the world as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations increase [{\ldots}] However, climate model simulations have not provided consistent corroboration ()"

INTENSIFICATION MECHANISM
"Throughout the world's oceans, coastal upwelling tends to operate predominetaly during the 'heating portions' of the year (spring and summer in subtropical latitudes, year-round in tropical latitudes) when, because of the much greater heat storage capacity of ocean waters compared with land surfaces , air temperature over a coastal landmass tends to increase relative to that over the adjacent sea"

"Eastern sides of oceans are characterized by much drier atmospheres than are their western sides. Because the most important greenhouse gas in earth's atmosphere is water vapor (), eastern ocean boundary regions tend innately to experience a reduced natural greenhouse effect. Consequently, local cooling by long wave radiation is rapid and efficient. This facilitates the relaxation of the thermal low-pressure cells that build up over the coastal landmass due to daytime heating.

However, as anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations increase  in the atmosphere, radiative cooling will be increasingly suppressed, particularly because the associated increases in air temperature will allow even greater concentrations of water vapor to be mainaned in the lower atmosphere thereby multiplying the effects of the anthropogenically added gases.  As a result, the rate of heating over the land will be further enhanced relative to that over the ocean, causing further intensification of the low-pressure cell over the coastal landmass. The resulting pressure gradient increase is matchedby a prportional wind increase, which causes a nonlinear (quadratic or greater) increse in intensity of resulting upwelling"

Well, the argument is not convincing. First, where the moisture come from if Peruvian coast is a desert? Second, increased salinisation would be expected if moisture comes from the ocean. Is that good for foodweb development? 

"In any case, it is far from clear that intensified upwelling would necessarily be favorable for fish production and other valued ecosystem characteristics [{\ldots}] Off Peru, and probably also off California, the projected decline in the Pacific near-equatorial trade wind circulation () should, on average, impart a more El Ni{\~n}o-like character to the subsurface source waters. This might well counteract the nutrient-enrichmenteffects of enhanced upward transfer rates.  [{\ldots}] "

"Thus the projected decline in the Pacific equatorial trade winds, in presaging weaker El Ni{\~n}o episodes, could have long-term adverse impacts on the fishery productivity of the Peru marine ecosystem even though the local upwelling rate may actually increase reather than decrease"

"... in a normal situation of moderate upewelling, upwelled nutrients support a productive in situ food web wherein photosynthesizing phytoplankton nouris a flourishing zooplankton comunity [{\ldots}]
But, with increased upwelling rate, the difference in typical generation times between phytoplankton and zooplankton may result in flushing the herbivorous zooplankton, that normally would exert controls on phytoplankton grwoth, from the upwelling zone. In a situation, which features an excess of upwelled nutrients, the rapidly multiplying phytoplankton may grow unrestrainedly in abundance [{\ldots}]
However, as the rate of offshore transport continues to increase particularly if the available small pelagic omnivorous fish may be subject of overly heavy fising, varous factors may combine to cause an abrupt ecosystem regime shift. For example, increasing sedimentation of unconsumed phytoplankton production onto the floor of the continental shelf may result in sea floor hypoxia and release of noxious products of anaerobic decomposition that include poisonous hydrogen sulfide and greenhosue-active methane. Increased transport of plankton into the offshore fronts may result in explosive breakouts of less mobile zooplanktivores such as jellyfish that may initially be retained within the fronts, but upon establishing critical mass may break out to infest the entire system where they may voraciously consume the eggs and larvae of fish () that may have earlier acted to constrain them through competition or predation (). Notably, jellyfish also seem particularly well equipped to deal with associated hypoxic conditions in the water column () that may accompany such a shift"

"Certain 'echoes' of this situation are becomeing evident in other regions. Repeated annual hypoxic 'dead zones' have been a recent development in the upwelling zone off Oregon (). Meanwhile, widespread marine hypoxia (), toxic red tides (), and jellyfish infestations () appear to represent increasingly unwelcome trends in many marine ecosystems of the world's oceans. Thus, whatever the actual effect on the primary productivity of these most productive of the world's regional marine ecosystems, the theorized climate change-related increases in upwelling-favorable winds in upwelling ecosystems discussed here would seem by a large to add momentum to these other unwelcome trends"

"One available mitigation action, spearate from dealing with the ultimate greenhouse gas issues themselves, would seem to be careful avoidance of destructive overfishing of small filter-feeding fishes, such as sardines, that are reasonably considered to be more or less effective in countering eutrophication, red tides and hypoxia ()"

abstract = {Coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems generally represent the most productive large marine ecosystems of the world's oceans, in terms of both primary production rates and tonnages of exploitable fish produced. The Peruvian upwelling system, in particular, stands out as a major factor in world fish production. The Pacific trade winds have traditionally been considered to be the primary driving force for the upwelling system off Peru, but are projected to weaken as climate change proceeds. This leads to concern that the upwelling process in the Peru system, to which its productivity is linked, may likewise weaken. However, other mechanisms involving greenhouse-associated intensification of thermal low-pressure cells over the coastal landmasses of upwelling regions suggest general intensification of wind-driven ocean upwelling in coastal upwelling regions of the world's oceans. But although certain empirical results have supported this expectation, it has not been consistently corroborated in climate model simulations, possibly because the scale of the coastal intensification may be small relative to the scales that are appropriately reflected in the standard models. Here we summarize available evidence for the intensification mechanism and present a proxy test that uses variations in water vapor, the dominant natural greenhouse gas, to offer multiple-realization empirical evidence for action of the proposed mechanism in the real world situation. While many potential consequences to the future of marine ecosystems would codepend on climate change-related changes in the thermocline and nutricline structures, an important subset, involving potential increased propensities for hypoxia, noxious gas eruptions, toxic red tide blooms, and/or jellyfish outbreaks, may depend more directly on changes in the upwelling-favorable wind itself. A prospective role of fisheries in either mitigating or reinforcing this particular class of effects is suggested.},

abstract = {Predicting the impact of carnivores on plants has challenged community and food web ecologists for decades. At the same time, the role of predators in the evolution of herbivore dietary specialization has been an unresolved issue in evolutionary ecology. Here, we integrate these perspectives by testing the role of herbivore diet breadth as a predictor of top-down effects of avian predators on herbivores and plants in a forest food web. Using experimental bird exclosures to study a complex community of trees, caterpillars, and birds, we found a robust positive association between caterpillar diet breadth (phylodiversity of host plants used) and the strength of bird predation across 41 caterpillar and eight tree species. Dietary specialization was associated with increased enemy-free space for both camouflaged (n = 33) and warningly signaled (n = 8) caterpillar species. Furthermore, dietary specialization was associated with increased crypsis (camouflaged species only) and more stereotyped resting poses (camouflaged and warningly signaled species), but was unrelated to caterpillar body size. These dynamics in turn cascaded down to plants: a metaanalysis (n = 15 tree species) showed the beneficial effect of birds on trees (i.e., reduced leaf damage) decreased with the proportion of dietary specialist taxa composing a tree species' herbivore fauna. We conclude that herbivore diet breadth is a key functional trait underlying the trophic effects of carnivores on both herbivores and plants.},

abstract = {Transitions between regimes with radically different properties are ubiquitous in nature. Such transitions can occur either smoothly or in an abrupt and catastrophic fashion. Important examples of the latter can be found in ecology, climate sciences, and economics, to name a few, where regime shifts have catastrophic consequences that are mostly irreversible (e.g., desertification, coral reef collapses, and market crashes). Predicting and preventing these abrupt transitions remains a challenging and important task. Usually, simple deterministic equations are used to model and rationalize these complex situations. However, stochastic effects might have a profound effect. Here we use 1D and 2D spatially explicit models to show that intrinsic (demographic) stochasticity can alter deterministic predictions dramatically, especially in the presence of other realistic features such as limited mobility or spatial heterogeneity. In particular, these ingredients can alter the possibility of catastrophic shifts by giving rise to much smoother and easily reversible continuous ones. The ideas presented here can help further understand catastrophic shifts and contribute to the discussion about the possibility of preventing such shifts to minimize their disruptive ecological, economic, and societal consequences.},

abstract = {Ocean deoxygenation often takes place in proximity to zones of intense upwelling. Associated concerns about amplified ocean deoxygenation arise from an arguable likelihood that coastal upwelling systems in the world's oceans may further intensify as anthropogenic climate change proceeds. Comparative examples discussed include the uniquely intense seasonal Somali Current upwelling, the massive upwelling that occurs quasi-continuously off Namibia and the recently appearing and now annually recurring 'dead zone' off the US State of Oregon. The evident 'transience' in causal dynamics off Oregon is somewhat mirrored in an interannual-scale intermittence in eruptions of anaerobically formed noxious gases off Namibia. A mechanistic scheme draws the three examples towards a common context in which, in addition to the obvious but politically problematic remedy of actually reducing 'greenhouse' gas emissions, the potentially manageable abundance of strongly swimming, finely gill raker-meshed small pelagic fish emerges as a plausible regulating factor.This article is part of the themed issue 'Ocean ventilation and deoxygenation in a warming world'.},

abstract = {From 2012 to 2016, California experienced one of the worst droughts since the start of observational records. As in previous dry periods, precipitation-inducing winter storms were steered away from California by a persistent atmospheric ridging system in the North Pacific. Here we identify a new link between Arctic sea-ice loss and the North Pacific geopotential ridge development. In a two-step teleconnection, sea-ice changes lead to reorganization of tropical convection that in turn triggers an anticyclonic response over the North Pacific, resulting in significant drying over California. These findings suggest that the ability of climate models to accurately estimate future precipitation changes over California is also linked to the fidelity with which future sea-ice changes are simulated. We conclude that sea-ice loss of the magnitude expected in the next decades could substantially impact California{\textquoteright}s precipitation, thus highlighting another mechanism by which human-caused climate change could exacerbate future California droughts.},

abstract = {The mean trophic level of the species groups reported in Food and Agricultural Organization global fisheries statistics declined from 1950 to 1994. This reflects a gradual transition in landings from long-lived, high trophic level, piscivorous bottom fish toward short-lived, low trophic level invertebrates and planktivorous pelagic fish. This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere. Fishing down food webs (that is, at lower trophic levels) leads at first to increasing catches, then to a phase transition associated with stagnating or declining catches. These results indicate that present exploitation patterns are unsustainable.},

Kuznetsov, Y.A. (1995) Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory,
Key reference for bifurcation: he seems to be the matematician that coined the concept!

"Nevertheless, with respect to ecosystems, the concept remains counterintuitive to many, and there is a risk of a divide between believers and skeptics"

"For conditions in which alternative equilibria exist, the initial state (i.e. place in the landscape [analogy of regime shift]) determines the equilibrium to which the system will settle"
THIS IS PATH DEPENDENCE...

"sometimes, models do not settle into a stable state (or equilibrium), but instead converge to an oscillating pattern (e.g. a predator-prey cycle) or a pattern of erratic fluctuations. All regimes to which a system moves asymptotically are known as 'attractors' (e.g. a point attracctor, a cycle or a strange attractor). By contrast, unstable structures, be they points, cycles or other structures, are known as 'repellers'.

The problem is, this is relative to the observer in time and space!!!!

those guys says: "fluctuation rather than stable states are obviously the rule"... however, isn't fluctuation into the stable states?? isn't a matter of scope, of scale??

"The term 'regime shift', which is also used in oceanography (), describes aptly sudden shifts in ecosystems"

"'perturbation' can trigger a regime shift. In models, a shift to a different attractor can be triggered by purely internally-generated fluctuations, such as predator-prey cycles or more complex dynamics. such events are called 'non-local bifurcations' or 'basin boundary collisions' (11,14). In practice, it will always be a blend of internal processes and external forces that generate fluctuations (17)"

"We consider the system to have alternative attractors if it can be in more than one 'stable state' for the same value of such an external conditon. It is important that this condition is really external, in the sense that it is not an interactive part of the system" 

"models of interacting populations often converge to cycles of chaotic dynamics rather than stable states ()"????

"Overall, the way in which dynacim systems respond to environmental flcutuations - the 'noisy clockwork' ()- is still poorly explored. One clearly important aspect to tackle is the question of how the frequency of environmental 'noise' affects the probability that the ecosystem will shift to another attractor (). A final important caveat with respecto to interpreting causality of shifts is the tendecy for researchers to neglect<u> the factors that undermine resilience slowly</u>, such as eutrophication or global warming (). Regime shifts are attributed all to easily to obvious stochastic events such as hurricanes () or species invasion ()"

"alternative states can coexist side-by-side"!!

"Models suggest that in spatially heterogeneous landscapes a local tendency to alternative stable states tends to sooth out on a larger scale"

"A special situation occurs if patches in one state benefit from the neighbouring area in the alternative state [{\ldots}] This tends to lead to pronounced self-organising spatial patterns (e.g. 'tiger bush'), and can cause the system to have alternative attractors on a landscape scale, even if this does not occur on a local scale ()"

"We consider the system to have alternative attractors if it can be in more than one 'stable state' for the same value of such an external condition. It is important that this condition is really external, in the sense that it is not an interactive part of the system" WHICH ONE IS... EVEN CLIME IS... CURRENTS IS...ALL OF THEM ARE DRIVEN BY SLOW VARIATIONS, AREN'T THEY? "A common misconception is the idea that all abiotic conditions are 'external. This  [{\ldots}] has caused the idea that situations in which local abiotic conditions are different in the alternative states should not be considered 'proper' alternative stable states () [{\ldots}] For simplicity, we can then treat the slow variable as an independent control parameter '" AHH OK, THAT'S MUCH BETTER

"In some systems, fast and slow component affect each other mutually in a way that leads to cycles () [{\ldots}] Such slow-fast cycles can also be understood by considering the processes atthe slow and the fast time scales separately"

So, autum is a cyclic regime shift... fisheries dominace is a cyclic regime shift... soft hypoxia is a cyclic regime shift!!!!!

OTRA VEZ CONFUSI{\'O}N:
"a significant jump in a time series does not necessarily imply alternative attractors. Sudden shifts myight be simply a result of a stepwise change in an important control parameter (e.g. a sudden change in temperature), or to the fact that a control parameter has passed a critical threshold that is not related to bifurcation (figure 2b [el diagrama de la S sin histeresis!!]). There is a statistical approach to infer whether or not alternative attractors are involved in a shift (42), based on the principle that all attractor shifts imply a phase in which the system is speeding up as it is diverging from a repeller. 

"The spatial analogue to jumps in time series is the occurrence of sharp boundaries between contrasting states [...] significant multimodality does not imply alternative attractors. As in the case of regime shifts, alternative explanations are a multimodal distribution of a driving factor, or a threshold response of the system that is not related to a bifurcation"

"In conclusion, one can obtain good indicators for the existence of alternative attractors from field data, but they can never be conclusive. There is always the possibility that discontinuities in time series or spatial patterns are due to discontinuities in some environmental factor. Alternatively, the system might simply have a threshold response (figure 2b- S shape). In addition to their practical importance, thresholds suggest that under different condition true alternative attractors could arise in the same system" MORE CONFUSING... SO THRESHOLD EFFECTS ARE NOT NECESARILY RS

"Another problem is the potentially long return time to equilibrium, which can suggest an alternative stable regime even if it is just a transitional phase" SO, ABRUPT CHANGE IS CONSIDER A RS

"Demonstration of a full hysteresis in response to a slow increase and subsequent decrease in a control factor also comes to proving the existence of alternative attractors [{\ldots}] However, the hysterectic pattern might not indicate alternative attractors if the response of the system is not fast enough relative to the rate of change in the control factor. Indeed, one will always see some hysteresis-like pattern unless the system response is much faster than the change in the control variable" SO, THERE IS REAL AND FAKE HYSTERESIS, THE REAL ONE IS BECAUSE ALTERNATIVE ATTRACTORS, THE FAKE ONE IS A DELAY IN RESPONSE ONCE THE PARAMETER HAS COME TO THE THRESHOLD POINT.

"Alternative attractors require positive feedbacks, and change among attractors implies a shift in dominant controlling feedbacks" If they are controlling, they are balancing feedbacks!!

"Positive feedbacks are sometimes interpreted as being almost synonymous with the possibility of switches between alternative attractors. Although this might seam reasonable intuitively, positive feedbacks only lead to alternative attractors if they are sufficiently strong. Thus, qualitative reasoning is not sufficient to infer alternative attractors from observed feedback loops" OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. BUT, WHERE ARE THE NEGATIVE ONES? ARE THEY MIXING FEEDBACKS WITH SHOCKS?

"Clearly, the absence of hints of alternative attractors in field data does not imply that they do not exist. The only way to falsify the existence of alternative attractors is to demostrate that the system settles eventually to the same regime from every initial condition"
